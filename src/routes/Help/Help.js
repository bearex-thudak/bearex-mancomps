      The manufacture and use phases have been identified as the two phases in
      which manufacturers can exert the most direct and immediate influence on
      environmental performance through design for the environment, operational
      and management initiatives. This paper presents the results of an analysis
      comparing two generations of microprocessors: the Pentium/spl reg/Pro and
      the Pentium/spl reg/4. Similar to previous studies, it examines the
      manufacture and use stages of the semiconductor and attempts to create an
      inventory based on life cycle methodology.
